# üí° Description

The published files can offer an improved privacy to protect you from ads, tracking, spyware, telemetry, malware,
advertising.
This applies to games, on websites and in regular programs on desktop, mobile systems and also smart tvs.

To use the full potential I recommend to set up a [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole).

The list are based on my own Pi-hole logs plus external list listed in the sources.json files.
Some external files are also cleaned by false positive records that I detected using them.
